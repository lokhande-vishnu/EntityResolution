## Reporting issues

When reporting issues please include as much detail as possible about your
operating system, dedupe version and python version. Whenever possible, please
also include a brief, self-contained code example that demonstrates the problem.

If dedupe is raising an exception, please paste a [full traceback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace).
